# Override for local Lighthouse runs so the built site loads assets from the
# same origin (localhost) instead of production. Use:
#   jekyll build --config _config.yml,_config.lighthouse.yml
url: http://localhost:4173
baseurl: ""
# Skip main-site assets (fonts, favicons) that aren't in _site to avoid 404s.
