# Eventuate

## What

Eventuate is a browser extension. It extracts information from [parkrun] results pages for inclusion in reports.

## Why

I wrote this while volunteering as a Run Director at the beautiful
[Brimbank parkrun], to make it easy to celebrate our community's achievements
on the [Brimbank parkrun Facebook page]. I am sharing it so that you get to
enjoy it too.

## How much

Free. For everyone. Forever. Of course.

## How

As soon as the latest results page loads for an event, you'll see some useful text before the results table is displayed, including:

- A summary of the number of finishers
- Any finishers who joined a milestone club
- Congratulations to new parkrunners
- A welcome to first-time visitors
- A celebration of personal bests
- A shout out to the walking and running clubs
- Cheers to our volunteers
- A reminder to bring a barcode
- And a beautiful bunch of facts and figures
