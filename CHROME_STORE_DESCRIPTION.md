📧 **Note to marketers:** Please don't contact me about SEO services, email
funnels, or social media growth strategies. If you genuinely want to help
Eventuate grow, the best thing you can do is find your nearest parkrun
(https://www.parkrun.com/#scroll-to-events) and get involved as a volunteer or
participant. Word of mouth beats SEO every day of the week—and it's way more
fun! 🏃‍♀️🏃‍♂️

## Instructions

1. Log into Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard
2. Navigate to the Eventuate extension listing
3. Edit the description
4. Add the above section at the end of the existing description
5. Save and submit for review
