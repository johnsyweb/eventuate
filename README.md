# Eventuate [![Mozilla / Firefox][mozilla-image]][Mozilla] [![Google Chrome / Chromium][chromewebstore-image]][Google Chrome]

Extracts information from parkrun event result pages for inclusion in reports.
It's not a run report generator, but will help you write a weekly report for an
event.

## Introduction

I wrote this while volunteering as a Run Director at the beautiful [Brimbank
parkrun][brimbank], to make it easy to celebrate our community's achievements on
the [Brimbank parkrun Facebook page][facebook]. I am sharing it so that you get
to enjoy it too.

I initially wrote this as a Firefox Add-On, as the developer tooling is pretty
good in this space and Firefox Browser Add-Ons are pretty easy to distribute.
However, once I worked out I could generate a userscript as part of the
automated release process and run it in any browser with a userscript manager,
including iOS and iPadOS devices, I switched to using that!

## Description

If you volunteer at [parkrun] and produce an event report to celebrate
achievements, this addon will make your life easier!

As soon as the latest results page loads for an event, you'll see a bunch of
useful text before the results table is displayed, including:

- Weekly event summary
- New milestone club members
- Kudos for new parkrunners
- Welcome for first-time visitors
- Celebrating personal bests
- Acknowledgement of walking and running groups
- Link to the full results
- Gratitude to volunteers
- Invitation to volunteer with a link to the roster
- Reminder to bring a barcode
- Overall event summary facts and figures

Shows participant statistics including 112 parkrunners, 8 volunteers, 3 milestone achievers, 8 first-timers, 17 personal bests, and various community statistics. Contains red notification banner indicating this is extracted data for report writing assistance.][eventuate-results-summary-image]

## Internationalisation

Eventuate automatically detects your browser's language and displays reports in
the appropriate language. Currently supported languages:

- **English** ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ (default)
- **German** ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª (Deutsch)

You can easily switch between languages using the flag buttons that appear at
the top of the Eventuate output. Your language preference is saved and will be
remembered across browser sessions.

### Adding a New Language

We welcome contributions to add support for additional languages! Here's how to
add a new language:

1. **Create a new translation file**:

   ```sh
   # Copy the English template
   cp src/translations/en.ts src/translations/[language-code].ts
   ```

2. **Translate all strings** in the new file. Each translation file contains:
   - Language metadata (flag emoji and language name)
   - Event summaries and introductions
   - Milestone celebration messages
   - Volunteer acknowledgments
   - Personal best celebrations
   - Loading messages and fallback text
   - Milestone club names (e.g., "10 club", "25 club", etc.)

3. **Register the new language** in `src/translations/index.ts`:

   ```typescript
   import { [language-code] } from './[language-code]';

   export const translations: Record<string, TranslationKeys> = {
     en,
     de,
     [language-code], // Add your new language here
   };
   ```

4. **Test your translation**:

   ```sh
   pnpm test
   pnpm build
   ```

5. **Submit a pull request** with your translation.

### Translation Guidelines

- Use British English spelling conventions (e.g., "colour" not "color")
- Maintain the friendly, celebratory tone of parkrun reports
- Keep milestone club names consistent with parkrun terminology
- Test with real parkrun data to ensure translations work correctly
- Consider cultural differences in how achievements are celebrated

### Supported parkrun Countries

Eventuate works with parkrun results pages from all countries. Adding
translations helps make the tool more accessible to parkrun communities
worldwide.

## Development status [![Node.js CI][ci-badge]][Node.js CI]

I wrote this for myself in an afternoon to see if I could do it and figured it
may be useful to others. I then spent a while over-engineering it in TypeScript
and adding some unit tests using `jest`.

## Building locally

### Prerequisites

This project uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage Node.js and Ruby versions, and
[corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) to manage pnpm. Here's how to
set up your development environment:

```sh
# Install mise (if you haven't already)
curl https://mise.run | sh

# Add mise to your shell (if not already done)
echo 'eval "$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
# or for bash:
echo 'eval "$(~/.local/bin/mise activate bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Install all tools specified in .tool-versions
mise install

# Enable corepack (comes with NodeJS)
corepack enable

# Verify installations
node --version
pnpm --version
ruby --version
bundle --version
```

**Note**: This project requires Ruby for Jekyll documentation builds. The `.tool-versions` file specifies:
- Node.js 24.10.0
- pnpm 10.5.2  
- Ruby 3.4.7

### Building the Extension

Once the tools are installed:

```sh
pnpm i        # Install the development dependencies
pnpm t        # Run unit tests
pnpm package  # Package up all the things for Firefox and Chromium browsers
pnpm web-ext:lint  # Verify package for Firefox
```

Or if Docker's more your thing:

```sh
docker buildx build . -o target
```

### Building the Userscript and Bookmarklet

The userscript and bookmarklet are built automatically as part of the
`pnpm package` command. They will be generated in:

- Userscript: `target/eventuate.user.js`
- Bookmarklet: `target/bookmarklet.md`

To build them individually:

```sh
pnpm webpack --config webpack.userscript.config.js
pnpm webpack --config webpack.bookmarklet.config.js
```

The userscript can be installed in browsers that support userscript managers
like [Tampermonkey][tampermonkey], [Userscripts][userscripts], or
[Greasemonkey][greasemonkey]. The bookmarklet can be used in any browser,
including Safari on iOS devices, by creating a bookmark with the generated
JavaScript code.

### Building the Documentation

The project includes Jekyll-based documentation that can be built locally:

```sh
# Install Jekyll dependencies
cd docs
bundle install

# Build the documentation site
bundle exec jekyll build --baseurl /eventuate

# Serve the documentation locally
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl /eventuate --port 4000
```

The documentation will be available at `http://localhost:4000/eventuate/` and includes:
- Project overview and features
- Installation instructions
- Internationalization support
- Development guidelines

## Running locally

First, let's turn the TypeScript files into a single JavaScript file to be
consumed by `web-ext`...

```sh
pnpm build:watch
```

...`:watch` means we can edit the `.ts` files and have our change reflected in
an instant.

Second, in another terminal, let's start up Firefox and see our code in
action...

```sh
pnpm start
```

## Installing in a browser from source

1. Download this repository to a suitable location on your computer.
1. In Firefox, navigate to "about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox"
1. Use the "Load Temporary Add-on..." button.
1. Browse to and open the file `manifest.json` from the location where it was
   saved.
1. The add-on will now appear in the add-on managerâ€™s list of installed add-ons
   and be ready to use
1. Navigate to a results page such as:
   - **English**: <https://www.parkrun.com.au/timboon/results/latestresults/>
   - **German**:
     <https://www.parkrun.com.de/priessnitzgrund/results/latestresults/>

Observe the additional details between the title and the event table.

## Requirements

This was built with [Firefox][firefox] in mind but also works in Chromium-based
browsers, using the `chromium` artefacts. Enjoy!

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on [GitHub]. Everyone interacting in
the eventuate project's codebases, issue trackers, _etcetera_ is expected to
follow the [code of conduct].

We use semantic commits in this project. Please see our [contibution
guidelines][contributing] for more information about the preferred commit
message format.

## Releasing

This project uses [semantic-release][semantic-release] to automate version
management and package releases. The release process is triggered automatically
when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

The process will:

1. Analyze commits to determine the next version number
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a new GitHub release
4. Build and attach extension packages:
   - Firefox extension (`.zip`)
   - Chrome extension (`.zip`)
   - Userscript (`.user.js`)
   - Bookmarklet installation page (`.html`)

To test the release process locally:

```sh
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token pnpm semantic-release --dry-run
```

The version number will be automatically incremented based on your commits:

- `fix:` â†’ patch (0.0.x)
- `feat:` â†’ minor (0.x.0)
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` â†’ major (x.0.0)
