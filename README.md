# Eventuate

Extracts information from parkrun results pages for inclusion in reports.

## Introduction

I occassionally volunteer as a Run Director at [parkrun](https://parkrun.com.au/) and produce an event report to celebrate achievements. I also write software occassionally to automate parts of my life. This is the confluence of these two interests.

## Development status

I wrote this for myself in an afternoon to see if I could do it and figured it may be useful to others. I then spent a while over-engineering it in TypeScript and adding some unit tests using `jest`. I don't fully understand how modules work in TypeScript and JavaScript and after bashing my head against the desk, I used Crackle to do the heavy lifting. It almost works like I'd like it to.

## Building locally

Use `pnpm`:

```sh
pnpm i // Install the development dependencies
pnpm t // Run unit tests
pnpm build // Package up all the things for Firefox and Chromium browsers
pnpm web-ext:lint // Verify package for Firefox
```

## Getting started

1. Download this repository to a suitable location on your computer.
1. In Firefox, navigate to "about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox"
1. Use the "Load Temporary Add-on..." button.
1. Browse to and open the file `manifest.json` from the location where it was saved.
1. The add-on will now appear in the add-on managerâ€™s list of installed add-ons and be ready to use
1. Navigate to a results page such as <https://www.parkrun.com.au/timboon/results/latestresults/>.

Observe the additional details between the title and the event table.
